# InstantHCCS

`InstantHCCS` is a hardcore 1/70 Community Service script for looping in Kingdom of Loathing designed to work if you are me, [WARriorer (#1634187)](https://api.aventuristo.net/av-snapshot?u=WARriorer). It most probably (read: definitely) won't work for you - the script has been optimized to use as few farming-relevant resources as possible with no redundancy (e.g. it is designed to not use all the Witchess fights as part of getting the Short-Order Cook's drop, and it will not dynamically fight more Witchess monsters in a situation where the user failed to increase the counter one of more times due to the lack of certain resources).

## Installation

This script is unlikely to run for most users out of the box. Thus, it cannot yet be checked out through the mafia GUI. To use the script, do the following:

1. Compile the script, following instructions in the [kol-ts-starter](https://github.com/docrostov/kol-ts-starter) (specifically, you'll need to set your own MOTHERSLIME_CLAN and VIP_CLAN in common.ts, so a compiled js script will not be provided).
2. Copy InstantHCCS.ccs from KoLmafia/ccs to your Mafia css directory.

### Not-Required Resources but used anyway

These hardcoded resources do not affect the run in any significant way as they are mostly used for farming profit. These may be safely removed when modifying the script (but would otherwise cause issues if the user attempts to naively run the script as is while lacking any of these resources).
