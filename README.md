# InstantHCCS

`InstantHCCS` is a hardcore Community Service script for looping in Kingdom of Loathing designed to work if you are me, [WARriorer (#1634187)](https://api.aventuristo.net/av-snapshot?u=WARriorer). It most probably (read: definitely) won't work for you.

## Installation

This script is unlikely to run for most users out of the box. Thus, it cannot yet be checked out through the mafia GUI. To use the script, do the following:

1. Compile the script, following instructions in the [kol-ts-starter](https://github.com/docrostov/kol-ts-starter) (specifically, you'll need to set your own MOTHERSLIME_CLAN and VIP_CLAN in common.ts, so a compiled js script will not be provided).
2. Copy InstantHCCS.ccs from KoLmafia/ccs to your Mafia css directory.

<sub><sup>Adapted from [loop-cs](https://github.com/MrFizzyBubbs/loop-cs) which was adapted from [loop-casual](https://github.com/Kasekopf/loop-casual)</sub></sup>

### Summary of Farming Resource/Skill Usage

A summary of key farming resources used is listed below. The same summary is generated at the end of each run, with a list of unique tasks that utilized each resource. <br />
<sub><sup>Note 1: Some of these are subject to variance, including but not limited to Free Banishes (due to Holiday Wanderers) and Peppermint Sprouts (depending on our luck in Summoning Candy Hearts).</sup></sub> <br />
